Iâ€™m a software developer with over 8 years of experience crafting end-to-end, data-driven solutions across finance and machine learning. My expertise lies in designing low-latency trading systems, market data infrastructure, and ML-powered applications. With a BS in Mathematics and an MS in Data Analytics, I deliver scalable systemsâ€”from high-performance backend systems to statistical models and data engineering pipelines. When not playing with data, Iâ€™m enjoying spending time playing music and working on digital art paintings.

My main interests:

* software development 
* Bayesian Statistics
* Functional & Topological Data Analysis
* Machine Learning & Deep Learning
* Dynamical systems & system identification
* Mathematical & Statistical Modeling
* Time Series Analysis & Modeling
